This document provide more details about how to setup ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and WildFly) with WildFly. It is based upon all the good work done in https://github.com/nathanleclaire/elk and http://wildfly.org/news/2015/07/25/Wildfly-And-ELK/.

  <IP_ADDRESS> 	elasticsearch logstash kibana

. Clone the repo:

  git clone https://github.com/arun-gupta/elk.git
  cd elk

. Run ELK stack:

  docker-compose up -d

. Run instrumented WildFly image:
